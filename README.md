 BlackThornProd Game Jam 3 - 2021 - Less Is More
 
 
Features:


Simple platformer with 4 levels and classic arrows/wasd and spacebar controls.

Double jump using the burdens you collect.

Carry one of the burdens to the exit portal to move on to the next level.

Timer per level with summary at the end to facilitate speed-runs.



------------------------------



I made this game 6 days for the BlackThornProd Game Jam 3 in 2021. The theme was "Less Is More."  Unfortunately, I was thoroughly uninspired by the theme so decided to go for a simple platformer, with the levels making the most out of one single mechanic (purposefully removing any hazards). 

The original take on the theme was to make a platformer where the less collectibles you have the better. Picking up collectibles makes you slower, heavier. However after testing, adding the dropping on double jump mechanic ended up being a lot more fun to play with and level design for.

I was going to try to make a narrative to go along with the game, but decided to remove the text prompts last minute in favour of faster transition as play-testers enjoyed the speed-running aspect more. The poem is below if you're curious!

Enjoy!

Soul Jump


Where thoughts are clouds 

and souls are flames

A young one called Lane,

Was jumping


She ran fast, swift, quickly:

At the end of the path,

Surely there’d be more

To see...


Each orb felt heavy

Yet pushed her further

A burden to carry

A lesson to master


She reached higher

She reached for more

Yet a lifetime later,

All’s the same as before


Don’t rush, don’t reach

Too much. In the night,

Even the hefty burden

Will keep you alight
